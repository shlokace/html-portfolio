<h1>The Best Movies according to Shlok.</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ramayan (Animated by director Yugo Saki)</h3>
<p>This taught many of the people of my generation the beauty of Indian history.<br /> Absolutely marvelous piece of cinematography and that too by a foreign director. </p>
<h3>Sholay</h3>
<p>Absolute classic of Bollywood. Still reigns as one of the best pictures Bollywood has ever produced.</p>
<h3>Kashmir Files</h3>
<p>Taught the Indian population about the genocide of Hindus that took place in the Indian state of Jammu&Kashmir.</p>
